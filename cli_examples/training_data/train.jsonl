{"prompt": "Title: Expression data from relapsing-remitting MS samples. Summary: One of our new major finding among the genes that contributes to MS susceptibility is ICSBP1. The so called disease modifying therapies like interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), possibly acting on the peripheral T-cells, reduce the disease activity and the clinical progression, with a MRI-detectable effect in preventing lesion burden and cerebral atrophy development in RR-MS. It suggests a critical role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) immune response and modulation in developing inflammation in the brain. We tested the hypothesis that the genetic effect of the susceptible allele ICSBP1 can impact the gene expression profile of molecules belonging to the interferon pathway. We therefore interrogated the PBMC for changes in gene expression profile. We correlate those changes with the minor allele frequency for ICSBP1, performing independent quantitative trait analysis for each treatment category. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Association with a p value < 0.05 have been used in follow up analysis. The regression coefficient of the Quantitative trait association represents the degree of correlation between the gene expression for each interrogated target gene and the minor allele frequency of the SNP for our gene of interest. This coefficient has been used as input in the subsequent Gene Set Enrichment Analysis performed in a pre-ranked approach. The resulting GSEA-SNP method rests on the assumption that SNPs underlying a disease phenotype might affect genes constituting a signaling pathway or genes with a common regulation. Therefore, GSEA-SNP can facilitate the identification of pathways or of underlying biological mechanisms. We used microarrays to capture gene expression profile of untreated subjects and of subjects under disease modyfing treatment (Interferon Beta and Glatiramer Acetate), in order to correlate gene expression and genotype data and in order to identify sets of genes specifically regulated in the different treatment categories..

{"prompt": "Title: Transcriptional mechanisms controlling direct motor neuron programming. Summary: Transcriptional programming of cell identity promises to open up new frontiers in regenerative medicine by enabling the efficient production of clinically relevant cell types. We examine if such cellular programming is accomplished by transcription factors that each have an independent and additive effect on cellular identity, or if programming factors synergize to produce an effect that is not independently obtainable. The combinations of Ngn2-Isl1-Lhx3 and Ngn2-Isl1-Phox2a transcription factors program embryonic stem cells to express a spinal or cranial motor neuron identity respectively. The two alternate expression programs are determined by recruitment of Isl1/Lhx3 and Isl1/Phox2a pairs to distinct genomic locations characterized by two alternative dimeric homeobox motifs. These results suggest that the function of programming modules relies on synergistic interactions among transcription factors and thus cannot be extrapolated from the study of individual transcription factors in a different cellular context. Overall design: In this study, we functionally characterize induced motor neurons that have been directly generated from ES cells via the forced expression of two different combinations of three transcription factors. Spinal motor neurons are induced via the expression of Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 (iNIL), while cortical motor neurons are induced via the expression of Ngn2, Isl1, and Phox2a (iNIP). Here we profile the gene expression patterns of both types of induced motor neurons, directed differentiation motor neurons, and control cells. In all, 20 microarray experiments are provided in this submission, including 3 replicates of a control condition, 3 replicates of cells that have 24hrs induction of iNIL, 2 replicates of induced spinal motor neurons (induction of iNIL for 48hrs) that have been Hb9-GFP sorted, 3 replicates of induced spinal motor neurons exposed to retinoic acid that have been Hb9-GFP sorted, 3 replicates of motor neurons that have been differentiated in vitro using RA and Hh signalling, 3 replicates of induced cortical motor neurons (induction of iNIP for 48hrs), and 3 replicates of cells in which Isl1 in induced alone (induction of iI for 48hrs). For ChIP-Seq Samples: In this study, we functionally characterize induced motor neurons that have been directly generated from ES cells via the forced expression of two different combinations of three transcription factors.

We characterize the binding of Lhx3 and Isl1/2 in iNIL cells, Phox2a and Isl1/2 in iNIP cells, and Isl1/2 in cells in which Isl1 is induced alone (iI).

{"prompt": "Title: Identification of genetic variants that affect histone modifications in human cells. Summary: Histone modifications are important markers of function and chromatin state, yet the DNA elements that direct them to specific locations in the genome are poorly understood. Here we use the genetic variation in Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines as a natural experiment to identify genetic differences that affect histone marks and to better understand their relationship with transcriptional regulation. Across the genome, we identified hundreds of quantitative trait loci that impact histone modification or RNA polymerase (PolII) occupancy. In many cases the same variant is associated with quantitative changes in multiple histone marks and PolII, as well as in DNaseI sensitivity and nucleosome positioning, indicating that these molecular phenotypes often share a single underlying genetic cause. \u00a0Variants that impact chromatin at distal regulatory sites frequently also direct changes in chromatin and gene expression at associated promoters; while most of these distal regulators enhance promoter activity, some act as distal chromatin silencers. Finally, we find that polymorphisms in transcription factor binding sites are often causally responsible for variation in local histone modification. \u00a0In summary, the class of variants identified here generate coordinated changes in chromatin both locally and sometimes at distant locations, frequently drive changes in gene expression, and likely play an important role in the genetics of complex traits.

Summary: Deletion of caudal/cdx genes alters hox gene expression and causes defects in posterior tissues and hematopoiesis. Yet, the defects in hox gene expression only partially explain these phenotypes. To gain deeper insight into Cdx4 function, we performed ChIP-seq combined with gene expression profiling in zebrafish, and identified the transcription factor spalt-like 4 (sall4) as a Cdx4 target. ChIP-seq revealed that Sall4 bound to its own gene locus and the cdx4 locus. Expression profiling showed that Cdx4 and Sall4 co-regulate genes such as hox, scl, and lmo2 that initiate hematopoiesis. Combined cdx4/sall4 gene knock-down impairs erythropoiesis, and overexpression of the Cdx4 and Sall4 target genes scl and lmo2 together rescued the erythroid program. These findings suggest that auto- and cross- regulation of Cdx4 and Sall4 establish a stable molecular circuit in mesoderm that facilitates the activation of the blood-specific program as development proceeds.

Summary: This dataset uses DNase-seq to profile the genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity of mES and mES-derived cells along an early pancreatic lineage and provides the locations of putative Transcription Factor (TF) binding sites using the PIQ algorithm. DNase-seq takes advantage of the preferential cutting of DNase I in open chromatin and steric blockage of of DNase I by tightly bound TFs that protect associated genomic DNA sequences. After deep sequencing of DNase I\u2013digested genomic DNA from intact nuclei, genome-wide data on chromatin accessibility as well as TF-specific DNase I protection profiles that reveal the genomic binding locations of a majority of TFs are obtained. Such TF signature \u2018DNase profiles\u2019 reflect the effect of the TF on DNA shape and local chromatin architecture, extending hundreds of base pairs from a TF binding site, and these profiles are centered on \u2018DNase footprints\u2019 at the binding motif itself, which reflects the biophysics of protein-DNA binding.

{"prompt": "Title: Genome-wide maps of HMGD1 and H1-bound nucleosomes.. Summary: Chromatin architectural proteins interact with nucleosomes to modulate chromatin accessibility and higher-order chromatin structure. While these proteins are almost certainly important for gene regulation they have been studied far less than the core histone proteins. Here we describe the genomic distributions and functional roles of two chromatin architectural proteins: histone H1 and the high mobility group protein HMGD1, in Drosophila S2 cells. Using ChIP-seq, biochemical and gene specific approaches, we find that HMGD1 binds to highly accessible regulatory chromatin and active promoters. In contrast, H1 is primarily associated with heterochromatic regions marked with repressive histone marks. However, the ratio of HMGD1 to H1 is better correlated with chromatin accessibility, gene expression and nucleosome spacing variation than either protein alone suggesting a competitive mechanism between these proteins. Indeed, we show that HMGD1 and H1 compensate each other's absence by binding reciprocally to chromatin resulting in changes to nucleosome repeat length and distinct gene expression patterns. Collectively our data suggest that dynamic and mutually exclusive binding of H1 and HMGD1 to nucleosomes and linker sequences may control the fluid chromatin structure that is required for transcriptional regulation. This study thus provides a framework to further study the interplay between chromatin architectural proteins and epigenetics in gene regulation.

{"prompt": "Title: Induced Cdx2 binding in embryonic stem cells and endodermal cells. Summary: Regulatory proteins can bind to different sets of genomic targets in various cell types or conditions. To reliably characterize such condition-specific regulatory binding we introduce MultiGPS, an integrated machine learning approach for the analysis of multiple related ChIP-seq experiments. MultiGPS is based on a generalized Expectation Maximization framework that shares information across multiple experiments for binding event discovery. We demonstrate that our framework enables the simultaneous modeling of sparse condition-specific binding changes, sequence dependence, and replicate-specific noise sources. MultiGPS encourages consistency in reported binding event locations across multiple-condition ChIP-seq datasets and provides accurate estimation of ChIP enrichment levels at each event. MultiGPS\u2019s multi-experiment modeling approach thus provides a reliable platform for detecting differential binding enrichment across experimental conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of MultiGPS with an analysis of Cdx2 binding in three distinct developmental contexts. By accurately characterizing condition-specific Cdx2 binding, MultiGPS enables novel insight into the mechanistic basis of Cdx2 site selectivity. Specifically, the condition-specific Cdx2 sites characterized by MultiGPS are highly associated with pre-existing genomic context, suggesting that such sites are pre-determined by cell-specific regulatory architecture. However, MultiGPS-defined condition-independent sites are not predicted by pre-existing regulatory signals, suggesting that Cdx2 can bind to a subset of locations regardless of genomic environment..

To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at ~300,000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide bisulfite sequence data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10%) 13,915 *cis* methylation QTLs (meQTLs), i.e., CpG sites in which changes in DNA methylation are associated with genetic variation at proximal loci. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes in all of these regulatory phenotypes.

{"prompt": "Title: Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein. Summary: Genetic variants that impact gene regulation are important contributors to human phenotypic variation. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made to identify genetic associations with differences in mRNA levels of nearby genes, namely, cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The phenotypic consequences of eQTLs are presumably due, in most cases, to their ultimate effects on protein expression levels. Yet, only few studies have quantified the impact of genetic variation on proteins levels directly. It remains unclear how faithfully eQTLs are reflected at the protein level, and whether there is a significant layer of cis regulatory variation acting primarily on translation or steady state protein levels. To address these questions, we measured ribosome occupancy by high-throughput sequencing, and relative protein levels by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in which we had previously measured transcript expression using RNA sequencing. We then mapped genetic variants that are associated with changes in transcript expression (eQTLs), ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). Most of the QTLs we detected are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, we found that eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a class of cis QTLs that specifically affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA levels; most of these QTLs have little effect on ribosome occupancy, and hence may arise from differences in post-translational regulation.

{"prompt": "Title: Nucleophosmin binding on the mouse X chromosomes. Summary: In mammals, one of the female X chromosomes and all imprinted genes are expressed exclusively from a single allele in somatic cells. To evaluate structural changes associated with allelic silencing, we have applied a recently developed Hi-C assay that uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation to mouse F1 hybrid systems. Results We find radically different conformations for the two female mouse X chromosomes. The inactive X has two superdomains of frequent intrachromosomal contacts separated by a boundary/hinge region. Comparison with the recently reported bipartite 3D structure of the human inactive X shows that the genomic content of the superdomains differs between species, but part of the hinge is conserved and located near the Dxz4/DXZ4 locus. In mouse, the hinge region also contains a minisatellite Ds-TR, and both Dxz4 and Ds-TR appear to be anchored to the nucleolus. Genes that escape X inactivation do not cluster but are located near the periphery of the 3D structure, as are regions enriched in CTCF or RNA polymerase. Fewer short-range intrachromosomal contacts are detected for the inactive alleles of genes subject to X inactivation, compared to the active alleles and to genes that escape X inactivation. This pattern is also evident for imprinted genes, in which more chromatin contacts are detected for the expressed allele. Conclusions By applying a novel Hi-C method to map allelic chromatin contacts, we discover a specific bipartite organization of the mouse inactive X chromosome that probably plays an important role in maintenance of gene silencing..

To balance the dosage of X-linked gene expression between the sexes one of the two X chromosomes in females is silenced by X inactivation initiated by up-regulation of the lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) Xist and recruitment of specific chromatin modifiers for silencing. The inactivated X chromosome becomes heterochromatic and visits a specific nuclear compartment adjacent to the nucleolus. We report a novel role for the X-linked lncRNA Firre in anchoring the inactive mouse X chromosome and preserving one of its main epigenetic features, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Similar to Dxz4, Firre is expressed from a macrosatellite repeat locus associated with a cluster of CTCF and cohesin binding specifically on the inactive X. CTCF binding initially present in both male and female mouse embryonic stem cells was found to be lost from the active X during development. The Firre and Dxz4 loci on the inactive X were preferentially located adjacent to the nucleolus. Knockdown of Firre RNA disrupted perinucleolar targeting and H3K27me3 levels in mouse fibroblasts, demonstrating an important role for this lncRNA in maintenance of one of the main epigenetic features of the X chromosome.

{"prompt": "Title: Bipartite structure of the inactive mouse X chromosome. Summary: A subset of genomic regions, including one of the female X chromosomes and all imprinted genes, are expressed exclusively from a single allele in somatic cells of mammals. To evaluate structural changes associated with allelic silencing, we used mouse F1 hybrid systems in which X inactivation is skewed and alleles can be distinguished based on single nucleotide polymorphisms to analyze chromatin contacts by a new Hi-C assay that uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation. Both DNase Hi-C and in situ DNase Hi-C reveal a radically different conformation between the two female mouse X chromosomes. Two superdomains of frequent intrachromosomal contacts separated by a hinge region are specifically observed on the inactive X chromosome both in vivo (brain) and in vitro (Patski cells). A bipartite 3D organization of the inactive X has been also reported in human lymphoblastoid cells, suggesting that this conserved structure probably plays an important role in maintenance of gene silencing on the inactive X. Interestingly, we found that the genomic content of the superdomains differs between species, but that part of the hinge region is conserved and located near the Dxz4/DXZ4 locus that binds CTCF on the inactive X. In mouse, the hinge region also contains a minisatellite Ds-TR adjacent to a promoter with strong CTCF binding. Both Dxz4 and Ds-TR bind nucleophosmin and are enriched in nucleolus-associated chromatin, suggesting anchoring to the nucleolus. Genes that escape X inactivation do not cluster but are preferentially located near the periphery of the 3D structure. Regions enriched in CTCF or RNA polymerase are also preferentially located on the periphery of the inactive X while LINE1 elements are preferentially on the interior. Genes subject to silencing exhibit fewer detectable intrachromosomal contacts than escape genes. This transcription-coupled pattern is also evident for imprinted genes, in which more chromatin contacts are detected on the expressed allele, suggesting greater constraint on the organization of expressed genomic regions.

{"prompt": "Title: Identifying multi-locus chromatin contacts in human cells using tethered multiple 3C. Summary: Background: DNA in the nucleus of a living cell carries out its functions in the context  of a complex, three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Several recently  developed methods, each an extension of the chromatin conformation capture (3C)  assay, have enabled the genome-wide profiling of chromatin contacts between  pairs of loci in yeast, fruit fly, human and mouse. Especially in complex  eukaryotes, data generated by these methods, coupled with other genome-wide  datasets, demonstrated that non-random chromatin folding correlates  strongly with cellular processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.  Here we describe a novel assay to map genome-wide chromatin contacts, tethered  multiple 3C (TM3C), that involves a simple protocol of restriction enzyme  digestion and religation of fragments upon agarose gel beads followed by deep  DNA paired-end sequencing. In addition to identifying contacts between pairs  of loci, TM3C enables identification of contacts among more than two loci  simultaneously.  Results: We use TM3C to assay the genome architectures of two human cell lines: KBM7,  a near-haploid chronic leukemia cell line, and NHEK, a normal diploid human  epidermal keratinocyte cell line. We confirm that the contact frequency maps  produced by TM3C exhibit features characteristic of existing genome architecture  datasets, including the expected scaling of contact probabilities with genomic  distance, as well as a low noise-to-signal ratio between inter- and  intrachromosomal contacts. We also confirm that TM3C captures several known  cell type-specific contacts, ploidy shifts and translocations, such as Ph+  formation in KBM7. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase mapping strategy that  separately maps chimeric subsequences within a single read, allowing us to  identify contacts involving three or four loci simultaneously, potentially  corresponding to combinatorial regulation events.  This mapping strategy also  greatly increases the number of distinct binary contacts identified and,  therefore, the coverage obtained for a fixed number of mapped reads. We  confirm a subset of the triplet contacts involving the IGF2-H19  imprinting control region (ICR) using PCR analysis for KBM7 cells.  Assaying the genome architecture of a near-haploid cell line allows us  to create 3D models of a human cell line without averaging  signal from two homologous copies of a chromosome.  Our 3D models of KBM7 show clustering of small  chromosomes with each other and large chromosomes with each other,  consistent with previous studies of the genome architectures of other  human cell lines.  Conclusion: TM3C is a simple protocol for ascertaining genome  architecture and can be used to identify simultaneous contacts among three  or four loci. Application of TM3C to a near-haploid human cell line  revealed large-scale features of chromosomal organization and  complex chromatin loops that may play a role in regulating reciprocal  expression of the IGF2 and H19 genes. Overall design: Analysis of the spatial organization of two human cell lines (KBM7, a near-haploid chronic leukemia cell line, and NHEK, a normal diploid human epidermal keratinocyte cell line) using tethered multiple 3C (TM3C), a novel and simple protocol for ascertaining genome architecture which can be used to identify simultaneous contacts among three or four loci in addition to binary contacts that can be identified using traditional chromosome conformation capture coupled with next generation sequencing (Hi-C)..

{"prompt": "Title: High resolution mapping of enhancer-promoter interactions [ChIA-PET]. Summary: RNA Polymerase II ChIA-PET data has revealed enhancers that are active in a profiled cell type and the genes that the enhancers regulate through chromatin interactions. The most commonly used computational method for analyzing ChIA-PET data, the ChIA-PET Tool, discovers interaction anchors at a spatial resolution that is insufficient to accurately identify individual enhancers. We introduce $Germ$, a computational method that estimates the likelihood that any two narrowly defined genomic locations are jointly occupied by RNA Polymerase II. $Germ$ takes a blind deconvolution approach to simultaneously estimate the likelihood of RNA Polymerase II occupation as well as a model of the arrangement of read alignments relative to locations occupied by RNA Polymerase II. Both types of information are utilized to estimate the likelihood that RNA Polymerase II jointly occupies any two genomic locations. We apply $Germ$ to RNA Polymerase II ChIA-PET data from embryonic stem cells to identify the genomic locations that are jointly occupied along with transcription start sites. We show that these genomic locations align more closely with features of active enhancers measured by ChIP-Seq than the locations identified using the ChIA-PET Tool. We also apply $Germ$ to RNA Polymerase II ChIA-PET data from motor neuron progenitors. Based on the $Germ$ results, we observe that a combination of cell type specific and cell type independent regulatory interactions are utilized by cells to regulate gene expression.

{"prompt": "Title: Genetic Control of Chromatin States in Humans Involves Local and Distal Chromosomal Interactions. Summary: Deciphering the impact of genetic variants on gene regulation is fundamental to understanding human disease. Although gene regulation often involves long-range interactions, it is unknown to what extent non-coding genetic variants influence distal molecular phenotypes. Here, we integrate chromatin profiling for three histone marks in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 75 sequenced individuals with LCL-specific Hi-C and ChIA-PET-based chromatin contact maps to uncover one of the largest collections of local and distal histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). Distal QTLs are enriched within topologically associated domains and exhibit largely concordant variation of chromatin state coordinated by proximal and distal non-coding genetic variants. Histone QTLs are enriched for common variants associated with autoimmune diseases and enable identification of putative target genes of disease-associated variants from genome-wide association studies. These analyses provide insights into how genetic variation can affect human disease phenotypes by coordinated changes in chromatin at interacting regulatory elements. Overall design: To identify genetic variants underlying chromatin variability in humans we mapped quantitative trait loci for three different histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from 76 individuals. These individuals have been extensively genotyped by the 1000 genomes project as part of the Yoruban population (YRI).

Summary: We used an established chemical labeling and affinity purification method coupled with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate the first genome-wide profile of hippocampal 5hmC following exposure to acute restraint stress and a one-hour recovery. This approach found a genome-wide disruption in 5hmC associated with acute stress response, primarily in genic regions, and identified known and potentially novel stress-related targets that have a significant enrichment for neuronal ontological functions. Integration of these data with hippocampal gene expression data from these same mice found stress-related hydroxymethylation correlated to altered transcript levels and sequence motif predictions indicated that 5hmC may function by mediating transcription factor binding to these transcripts. Together, these data reveal an environmental impact on this newly discovered epigenetic mark in the brain and represent a critical step toward understanding stress-related epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression and can lead to the development of psychiatric disorders.

Summary: Noncoding variants play a central role in the genetics of complex traits, but we still lack a full description of the main molecular pathways through which they act. Here we used molecular data to quantify the contribution of cis-acting genetic effects at each major stage of gene regulation from chromatin to proteins, within a population sample of Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We performed 4sU metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs to identify genetic variants that affect transcription rates. As expected, we found an important contribution of genetic variation via chromatin, contributing ~65% of eQTLs (expression Quantitative Trait Loci). The remaining eQTLs, which are not asso- ciated with chromatin-level variation, are highly enriched in transcribed regions, and hence may affect expression through co- or post-transcriptional processes.

{"prompt": "Title: Thousands of novel translated open reading frames in humans inferred by ribosome footprint profiling.. Summary: Accurate annotations of protein coding regions are essential for understanding how genetic information is translated into biological functions. The recent development of ribosome footprint profiling provides an important new tool for measuring translation. Here we describe riboHMM, a new method that uses ribosome footprint data along with gene expression and sequence information to accurately infer translated sequences. We applied our method to human lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 7,863 previously unannotated coding sequences, including 445 translated sequences in pseudogenes and 2,442 translated upstream open reading frames. We observed an enrichment of harringtonine-treated ribosome footprints at the inferred initiation sites, validating many of the novel coding sequences. In aggregate, the novel sequences exhibit significant signatures of purifying selection indicative of protein-coding function, suggesting that many of the novel sequences are functional. We observed that nearly 40% of bicistronic transcripts showed significant negative correlation in the levels of translation of their two coding sequences, suggesting a key regulatory role for these novel translated sequences. Despite evidence for their functional importance, the novel peptide sequences were detected by mass spectrometry at a lower rate than predicted based on data from annotated proteins, thus suggesting that many of the novel peptide products may be relatively short-lived. Our work illustrates the value of ribosome profiling for improving coding annotations, and significantly expands the set of known coding regions.

We develop a new type of high-dimensional machine learning model, the Cooperative Chromatin Model (CCM), that is capable of predicting a large fraction of genome-widepromoters chromatin accessibility at basepair-resolution in a range of human and mouse cell types from DNA sequence alone. We confirm that a CCM accurately predicts chromatin accessibility, even of a vast array of synthetic DNA sequences, with a novel CrispR-based method of highly efficient site-specific DNA library integration.

We established a panel of iPSCs from 58 well-studied Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); 14 of these lines were further differentiated into cardiomyocytes. We characterized regulatory variation across individuals and cell types by measuring RNA, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. Regulatory variation between individuals is lower in iPSCs than in the differentiated cell types, consistent with the intuition that developmental processes are generally canalized. While most cell-type- specific regulatory effects lie in chromatin that is open only in the affected cell-types, we find that 20% of cell-type specific effects are in shared open chromatin. Finally, we developed deep neural network models to predict open chromatin regions in these cell types from DNA sequence alone and were able to use the sequences of segregating haplotypes to predict the effects of common SNPs on tissue-specific chromatin accessibility.

To do so, we established a panel of iPSCs from 58 well-studied Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); 14 of these lines were further differentiated into cardiomyocytes. We characterized regulatory variation across individuals and cell types by measuring gene expression levels, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. Our analysis focused on a comparison of inter-individual regulatory variation across cell types. While most cell type-specific regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs) lie in chromatin that is open only in the affected cell types, we found that 20% of cell type-specific regulatory QTLs are in shared open chromatin. This observation motivated us to develop a deep neural network to predict open chromatin regions from DNA sequence alone. Using this approach, we were able to use the sequences of segregating haplotypes to predict the effects of common SNPs on cell type-specific chromatin accessibility..

Summary: Structural variants can contribute to oncogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, yet, 2 despite their importance, the identification of structural variants in cancer genomes remains 3 challenging. Here, we present an integrative framework for comprehensively identifying 4 structural variation in cancer genomes. For the first time, we apply next-generation optical 5 mapping and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques to6 systematically detect SVs in a variety of cancer cells. Combined with whole genome 7 sequencing, we identify and characterize structural variants in up to 29 commonly used 8 normal and cancer cell lines. We find that each method has unique strengths in identifying 9 different classes of structural variants and at different scales, suggesting that integrative 10approaches are likely the only way to comprehensively identify structural variants in the 11genome. Studying the impact of the structural variants in cancer cell lines, we identify 12widespread structural variation events affecting replication timing and the functions of non-13coding sequences in the genome, including the deletion of distal regulatory sequences, 14alteration of DNA replication timing, and the creation of novel 3D chromatin structural 15domains.

{"prompt": "Title: A genome-wide framework for mapping gene regulation via cellular genetic screens. Summary: Over one million candidate regulatory elements have been identified across the human genome, but nearly all are unvalidated and their target genes uncertain. Approaches based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants, and in resolution by linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, eQTL-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed by single-cell RNA-seq. Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.

Summary: We used immunostaining and FACS to enrich for distinct neural cell types at multiple stages of Drosophila neurogenesis for RNA-Seq In Drosophila melanogaster, cell-type specification during early nervous system development requires precise regulation of gene expression in time and space. To investigate the gene regulation patterns in early neuronal development, we developed a method 'DIV-SortSeq'    to enrich for specific neuroglial cell types for RNA sequencing: from early columnar subdivision and specification, through neuroglial differentiation. DIV-SortSeq recapitulates many of the known protein-coding transcriptome dynamics, as well as novel transcriptional regulatory patterns. We also performed nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of whole embryos - Fractionation-Seq - to assess temporal changes in subcellular localization of transcripts during embryogenesis.

{"prompt": "Title: Integrated miRNA/mRNA-Seq of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Withdrawal Circuit. Summary: Nicotine dependence is responsible for perpetuating the adverse health effects due to tobacco use, the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Nicotine is an agonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are enriched in the habenulo-interpeduncular withdrawal circuit. Drugs of abuse, including nicotine, induce stable neuroadaptations, requiring protein synthesis through regulation of transcription factors, epigenetic mechanisms, and non-coding RNAs. It also been shown that miRNAs in brain are regulated by nicotine and that miRNA dysregulation contributes to brain dysfunction, including drug addiction. While much is known about the neurocircuitry responsible for the behaviors associated with nicotine reward or withdrawal, the underlying mechanisms of how changes in behavior are induced are less clear. Using miRNA- and mRNA-Seq, we demonstrate that there are widespread changes in both miRNA and mRNA expression in the IPN and MHb during acute nicotine withdrawal. Conserved, differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted to target inversely regulated mRNAs. This dataset represents a valuable resource, identifying a multitude of miRNAs/genes, which upon further study may reveal new mechanisms underlying the neuroadaptations of nicotine dependence and the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Overall design: Male C5BL/6J mice were treated with chronic nicotine (NIC) or control tartaric acid solution (TA) orally. Additional nicotine withdrawal groups were treated with nicotine and then spontaneously withdrawn for 48 hours (NAWD) or 4 weeks (NLWD).

{"prompt": "Title: Inhibiting YAP1 in hepatoblastoma drives therapeutic differentiation of tumor cells to functional hepatocyte-like cells. Summary: Despite advances in surgical care and chemotherapeutic regimens, the five-year survival rate for Stage IV Hepatoblastoma (HB), the predominant pediatric liver tumor, remains at 27%. YAP1 and \u00df-Catenin co-activation occur in 80% of children's HB; however, a lack of conditional genetic models precludes exploration of tumor maintenance and therapeutic targets. Thus, the clinical need for a targeted therapy remains unmet. Given the predominance of YAP1 and \u00df-catenin activation in children's tumors, we sought to evaluate YAP1 as a therapeutic target in HB. We engineered the first conditional murine model of HB using hydrodynamic injection to deliver transposon plasmids encoding inducible YAP1S127A, constitutive \u00df-CateninDelN90, and a luciferase reporter to murine liver. Tumor regression was evaluated using in vivo bioluminescent imaging, and tumor landscape characterized using RNA sequencing, ATAC sequencing and DNA foot-printing. Here we show that YAP1 inhibition mediates >90% tumor regression with survival for 230+ days in mice. Mechanistically, YAP1 inhibition induces a cell fate switch driving therapeutic differentiation of HB tumors into Ki-67 negative \u201chbHep cells\u201d with hepatocyte-like morphology and mature hepatocyte gene expression.

{"prompt": "Title: Translation initiation site profiling reveals widespread synthesis of non-AUG-initiated protein isoforms in yeast. Summary: Genomic analyses in budding yeast have helped to define the foundational principles of eukaryotic gene expression, but have systematically excluded specific classes of potential coding regions, including those with non-AUG start codons. Without methods to define coding regions empirically, the prevalence of these non-canonical coding regions has been impossible to assess. Here, we applied an experimental approach to globally annotate translation initiation sites in yeast and identified a class of 149 genes that encode N-terminally extended alternate protein isoforms that result from translation initiation at non-AUG codons upstream of the annotated AUG start codon. These alternate isoforms are produced in concert with canonical isoforms and are translated with a high degree of specificity, resulting from initiation at only a small subset of possible start codons in 5' leader regions. Their translation is enriched during meiosis, and is induced by low eIF5A levels, which are observed in this context. These findings reveal widespread production of non-canonical protein isoforms and, more generally, show unexpected complexity to the rules by which the budding yeast genome is decoded.

{"prompt": "Title: Genus-wide characterization of bumblebee genomes provides insights into their evolution and variation in ecological and behavioral traits Genome sequencing and assembly. Summary: Bumblebees are a diverse group of globally important pollinators in natural ecosystems and for agricultural food production. With both eusocial and solitary life-cycle phases, and some social parasite species, they are especially interesting models to understand social evolution, behavior, and ecology. Reports of many species in decline point to pathogen transmission, habitat loss, pesticide usage, and global climate change, as interconnected causes. These threats to bumblebee diversity make our reliance on a handful of well-studied species for agricultural pollination particularly precarious. To broadly sample bumblebee genomic and phenotypic diversity, we de novo sequenced and assembled the genomes of 17 species, representing all 15 subgenera, producing the first genus-wide quantification of genetic and genomic variation potentially underlying key ecological and behavioral traits. The species phylogeny resolves subgenera relationships while incomplete lineage sorting likely drives high levels of gene tree discordance. Five chromosome-level assemblies show a stable 18-chromosome karyotype, with major rearrangements creating 25 chromosomes in social parasites. Differential transposable element activity drives changes in genome sizes, with putative domestications of repetitive sequences influencing gene coding and regulatory potential. Dynamically evolving gene families and signatures of positive selection point to genus-wide variation in processes linked to foraging, diet and metabolism, immunity and detoxification, as well as adaptations for life at high altitudes. Our study reveals how bumblebee genes and genomes have evolved across the Bombus phylogeny and identifies variations potentially linked to key ecological and behavioral traits of these important pollinators..

Summary: Purpose: we utilized a mouse model that permanently labels neurons activated throughout a specific experience to decipher the interplay between chromatin accessibility, 3D-chromatin architecture and transcriptional changes across different memory phases. Non activated (basal) and activated neurons during memory encoding (early), consolidation (late) and recall (reactivated) were sorted and subjected to nuclear RNA sequencing (nRNA-seq) to determine gene expression, ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) to assess chromatin accessibility, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to identify global 3D -genome architecture and promoter capture Hi-C to identify the long range promoter-enhancer interactions.  Results: We have found that during each memory phase, the same promoters interact more frequently with a distinct subset of enhancers (i.e. unique). We also identified a smaller subset of interactions in which the promoters were interacting with the same enhancers across different memory phases (i.e. common). Furthermore, Reactivated neurons presented significantly stronger interaction scores (as calculated by CHiCAGO). Hence, although the number of unique interactions was similar across early, late and reactivated states, stronger interaction scores indicate that specific promoter- enhancer interactions occur more frequently during memory recall. Overall design: By utilizing promoter-capture Hi-C (pc-HiC) technique, we studied the precise changes that occur in long-range promoter-enhancers interactions during the process of memory encoding, consolidation and recall.

Results: Our differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed relatively low amount of changes in the early phase, when compared to basal-state neurons (Basal vs. Early).

Results: Our analysis revealed dynamic changes in compartments organization, where we observed re-localization of large chromatin segments from inactive to permissive environment (and vice versa) during the initial and late phase of memory formation. Interestingly, 52% of the regions in the early phase that switched from B to A maintained that state in the late phase (i.e. remained in state A. Moreover, nearly all these regions significantly overlapped with gained DARs identified in our ATAC-seq analysis, confirming the transition of sub-compartment from inactive to permissive environment.

{"prompt": "Title: Cell-type, single-cell, and spatial signatures of brain-region specific splicing in postnatal development. Summary: Alternative RNA splicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of such regional variation is unknown. Here we present the first single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions, by performing single cell long-read transcriptome sequencing in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7. Using isoform tests for brain-region specific DIE, which outperform exon-based tests, we detect hundreds of brain-region specific DIE events traceable to specific cell-types. Many DIE events correspond to functionally distinct protein isoforms, some with just a 6-nucleotide exon variant. In most instances, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. Cell types indigenous to only one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, where for example, the choroid plexus epithelium manifest unique transcription start sites. However, for some genes, multiple cell-types are responsible for DIE in bulk data, indicating that regional identity can, although less frequently, override cell-type specificity. We validated our findings with spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing, yielding the first spatially resolved splicing map in the postnatal mouse brain (www.isoformAtlas.com). Our methods are highly generalizable. They provide a robust means of quantifying isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution, and reveal how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity to serve function.

{"prompt": "Title: Effects of sheared chromatin length on ChIP-seq quality and sensitivity. Summary: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel, high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the method of choice for identifying, on a genome-wide scale, the segments of DNA bound by specific transcription factors (TFs) or in chromatin with particular histone modifications. However, the quality of ChIP-seq datasets vary over a wide range, with a substantial fraction being of intermediate to poor quality. Such experimental variability can lead to many false positives or false negatives, impairing the ability to interpret the data. Thus, it is important to discern and control the factors that contribute to variation in ChIP-seq. In this study we focus on the sonication step to produce sheared chromatin, a variable controllable by the user and applicable to all ChIP-seq protocols. We systematically varied the amount of shearing of fixed chromatin from a mouse erythroid cell line, carefully measured the distribution of resultant fragment lengths using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, and then immunoprecipitated these batches of chromatin using highly specific antibodies against either TAL1 or CTCF. We found that the level of sonication, which was affected by both the number of sonication cycles, as well as the starting cell number, had a pronounced impact on the quality of resulting ChIP-seq signals. Specifically, over-sonication led to degradation of quality (e.g. increased background and reduction in signal), while the impact of under-sonication of chromatin differed between the two transcription factors, leading to the loss of sites occupied by TAL1 but not those bound by CTCF. We leveraged these findings to produce a set of CTCF ChIPs-seq datasets in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, including several rare cell types. Together, these results suggest that the amount of sonication is a key variable in success of ChIP-seq experiments, and that carefully monitoring the level of chromatin sonication is one way to improve ChIP-seq quality and reproducibility, which in turn facilitates low input ChIP-seq in rare cell types. Overall design: We systematically varied the extent of sonication of fixed chromatin from G1E-ER4+E2 cells, carefully measured the distribution of resultant fragment lengths using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, and then immunoprecipitated these batches of chromatin using highly specific antibodies against either TAL1 or CTCF. Following ChIP-seq library preparation, these samples were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. The datasets were then examined by both subjective visual assessments of the signal tracks at various loci on the genome browser, as well as established, genome-wide, objective quality metrics to determine the effects of sheared chromatin length on ChIP-seq quality and sensitivity.

Summary: Tumor epitopes \u2013 peptides that are presented on surface-bound MHC I proteins - provide targets for cancer immunotherapy and have been identified extensively in the annotated protein-coding regions of the genome. Motivated by the recent discovery of translated novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we hypothesized that cancer-associated processes could generate nuORFs that can serve as a new source of tumor antigens that harbor somatic mutations or show tumor-specific expression. To identify cancer-specific nuORFs, we generated Ribo-seq profiles for 29 malignant and healthy samples. These included primary normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, patient-derived primary glioblastoma (GBM) and melanoma cell cultures, primary healthy melanocytes, as well as established colon carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. These also included B721.221 cells, the parental cell line previously used to generate 92 single HLA allele-expressing lines from which we collected mono-allelic MHC I immunopeptidome data. We developed a hierarchical approach to identify translated novel unannotated open reading frames that leverages the large amount of Ribo-seq data we have generated in order to uncover lowly expressed nuORFs, while also preserving tissue specificity. We  constructed a database of novel unannotated ORFs (nuORFdb) and used it to analyze mass spectrometry datasets of MHC I-bound peptides, where we detected peptides from 3,555 nuORFs. Additionally, we used nuORFdb to identify cancer-specific nuORFs, as well as nuORFs harboring cancer-specific somatic variants as potential sources of neoantigens in cancer. *This repository contains data from the publicly available cell lines used in this study, including B721.221 cells, A375 cells, HCT116 cells and primary healthy melanocytes (Thermo C0025C).

{"prompt": "Title: Concerted modification of nucleotides at functional centers of the ribosome revealed by single-molecule RNA modification profiling. Summary: Nucleotides in RNA and DNA are chemically modified by numerous enzymes that alter their function. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is modified at more than 100 locations, particularly at highly conserved and functionally important nucleotides. During ribosome biogenesis, modifications are added at various stages of assembly. The existence of differently modified classes of ribosomes in normal cells is unknown because no method exists to simultaneously evaluate the modification status at all sites, within a single rRNA molecule. Using a combination of yeast genetics and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we developed a reliable method to track the modification status of single rRNA molecules at 37 sites in 18S rRNA and 73 sites in 25S rRNA. We use our method to characterize patterns of modification heterogeneity and identify concerted modification of nucleotides found near functional centers of the ribosome. Distinct undermodified subpopulations of rRNAs accumulate upon loss of Dbp3 or Prp43 RNA helicases, suggesting overlapping roles in ribosome biogenesis. Modification profiles are surprisingly resistant to change in response to many genetic and environmental conditions that affect translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing. The ability to capture single-molecule RNA modification profiles provides new insights into the roles of nucleotide modifications in RNA function. Overall design: We sequenced 33 samples of 18S and 25S ribosomal rRNA. 3 replicates of wild type yeast and 3 replicates of wild type shifted to cold.

{"prompt": "Title: Deciphering the Impact of Genetic Variation on Human Polyadenylation using APARENT2. Summary: Genetic variants that disrupt polyadenylation can cause or contribute to genetic disorders. Yet, due to the complex cis-regulation of polyadenylation, variant interpretation remains challenging. Here, we introduce a residual neural network model, APARENT2, that can infer 3'-cleavage and polyadenylation from DNA sequence more accurately than any previous model. This model generalizes to the case of alternative polyadenylation (APA) for a variable number of polyadenylation signals. We demonstrate APARENT2's performance on several variant datasets, including functional reporter data and human 3' aQTLs from GTEx. We apply neural network interpretation methods to gain insights into disrupted or protective higher-order features of polyadenylation. We fine-tune APARENT2 on human tissue-resolved transcriptomic data to elucidate tissue-specific variant effects. By combining APARENT2 with models of mRNA stability, we extend aQTL effect size predictions to the entire 3' untranslated region. Finally, we perform in-silico saturation mutagenesis of all human polyadenylation signals and compare the predicted effects of >44 million variants against gnomAD. While loss-of-function variants were generally selected against, we also find specific clinical conditions linked to gain-of-function mutations. For example, we detect an association between gain-of-function mutations in the 3'-end and Autism Spectrum Disorder. To experimentally validate APARENT2's predictions, we assayed clinically relevant variants in multiple cell lines, including microglia-derived cells. References and variant APA libraries were cloned into a reporter. APA profiling data was obtained from RNA-seq of 3 different cell lines (HEK293T, SK-N-SH, and HMC3)  with 2 replicates of each library. Polyadenylation  cleavage position was determined for mapped reads, and then UMIs were collapsed to determine measured variant log odds ratio of cleavage.

However, de novo induction of RNA editing in response to environmental factors is an uncommon phenomenon. While APOBEC3A edits many mRNAs in monocytes/macrophages in response to hypoxia and interferons, the physiological significance of such editing is unclear. Here we show that the related APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase induces site-specific C-to-U RNA editing in natural killer (NK), CD8+ T cells and lymphoma cell lines upon cellular crowding and hypoxia. RNA seq analysis of hypoxic NK cells reveals C-to-U recoding mRNA editing in dozens of genes including multiple translational and ribosomal genes. APOBEC3G promotes Warburg-like metabolic remodeling and reduces proliferation of HuT78 T cells under similar conditions. Hypoxia-induced RNA editing by APOBEC3G can be mimicked by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and occurs independently of HIF-1a.

{"prompt": "Title: MUC1-C represses the RASSF1A tumor suppressor and activated Kras signaling in human carcinoma cells. Summary: RASSF1A encodes a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS'RAF'MEK'ERK signaling and is one of the most frequently inactivated genes in human cancers. MUC1-C is an oncogenic effector of the cancer cell epigenome that is overexpressed in diverse carcinomas. We show here that MUC1-C represses RASSF1A expression in multiple types of KRAS wild-type and mutant cancer cells. Mechanistically, MUC1-C occupies the RASSF1A promoter in a complex with the ZEB1 transcriptional repressor. In turn, MUC1-C/ZEB1 complexes recruit DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) to the CpG island in the RASSF1A promoter. Targeting MUC1-C, ZEB1 and DNMT3b thus decreases methylation of the CpG island and derepresses RASSF1A transcription. We also show that targeting MUC1-C downregulates KRAS signaling with decreases in MEK/ERK activation, which is of importance for RAS-mediated tumorigenicity. These findings define a previously unrecognized role for MUC1-C in suppression of RASSF1A and support targeting MUC1-C as an approach for inhibiting KRAS signaling. Overall design: Using Lentiviral vector, a control shRNA hairpin and shRNA against MUC1-C were used to generate the stably silenced MUC1-C and control cell lines of BT-549 and A549 cells respectively.  Total RNA were isolated from 3 different sets of control shRNA and MUC1-shRNA for both BT549 and A549 cell types and used for RNA-seq library preparation.. The data type is", "completion": "RNA-Seq"}
{"prompt": "Title: MUC1-C ACTIVATES THE NURD COMPLEX IN DEDIFFERENTIATION OF TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREASTCANCER CELLS. Summary: The NuRD chromatin remodeling and deacetylation complex, which includes MTA1, MBD3, CHD4 and HDAC1 among other components, is of importance for development and cancer progression. The oncogenic MUC1-C protein activates EZH2 and BMI1 in the epigenetic reprogramming of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. However, there is no known link between MUC1-C and chromatin remodeling complexes. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C binds directly to the MYC HLH/LZ domain. In turn, we identified a previously unrecognized MUC1-C\u00aeMYC pathway that regulates the NuRD complex. We show that MUC1-C/MYC complexes selectively activate the MTA1 and MBD3 genes and posttranscriptionally induce CHD4 expression in basal- and not luminal-type BC cells. The results further show that MUC1-C forms complexes with these NuRD components on the ESR1 promoter. In this way, silencing MUC1-C (i) decreased MTA1/MBD3/CHD4/HDAC1 occupancy and increased H3K27 acetylation on the ESR1 promoter, and (ii) induced ESR1 expression and downstream estrogen response pathways. We also demonstrate that targeting MUC1-C and these NuRD components induces expression of FOXA1, GATA3 and other markers associated with the luminal phenotype. These findings and results from gain-of-function studies support a model in which MUC1-C activates the NuRD complex in driving luminal\u00aebasal dedifferentiation and plasticity of TNBC cells. Overall design: BT-549 and SUM149 cells were transfected to stably express a control shRNA (CshRNA) or a MUC1shRNA. Total RNA was isolated from three different sets of the (i) BT-549/CshRNA and BT-549/MUC1shRNA cells, and (ii) SUM149/CshRNA and SUM149/MUC1shRNA cells.

{"prompt": "Title: MUC1-C Drives Lineage Plasticity in Progression to Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer. Summary: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a highly aggressive malignancy of increasing prevalence with an unmet need for targeted therapeutic approaches. The oncogenic MUC1-C protein is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and NEPC; however, there is no known role for MUC1-C in driving lineage plasticity to these advanced PC phenotypes. The present studies demonstrate that upregulation of MUC1-C in androgen-independent (AI) PC cells suppresses androgen receptor (AR) axis signaling and induces the neural BRN2 transcription factor by a previously unrecognized MYC-mediated mechanism. MUC1-C activates the BRN2 pathway in association with induction of MYCN, EZH2 and NE differentiation markers (ASCL1, AURKA and SYP), which are linked to NEPC progression. We also show that MUC1-C suppresses the p53 pathway, induces the Yamanaka pluripotency factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) and drives stemness. Of potential clinical relevance, targeting MUC1-C decreases PC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity, supporting the treatment of CRPC and NEPC with agents directed against this oncoprotein. These findings and the demonstration that MUC1-C is upregulated and associated with suppression of AR signaling, and increases in BRN2 expression and the NEPC score in PC tissues highlight the unanticipated importance of MUC1-C as a master effector of lineage plasticity in progression to advanced PC with NE features. Overall design: LNCaP-AI and DU-145 cells stably expressing a tet-MUCshRNA vector were treated with vehicle control or doxycycline. Total RNA from cells cultured in triplicates was isolated and used for library preparation.. The data type is", "completion": "RNA-Seq"}
