{"prompt": "Title: The landscape of alternative splicing in aggressive prostate cancers. Summary: We sought to define the landscape of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in prostate cancers and the relationship of exon choice to known genetic driver alterations. To do so, we compiled a meta-dataset comprised of RNA-Seq samples from publicly available sources representing a range of phenotypes from normal tissue to drug resistant metastases. We subjected these samples to exon-level analysis with purpose-built software. We then correlated transcriptional signatures of cancer driver pathways with these alternative splicing events and discovered that Myc signaling was correlated with incorporation of a set of cassette exons found in RNA binding proteins. We experimentally verified this finding in a human prostate cell transformation assay. Our results connect changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing to oncogenic alterations common in prostate and many other cancers. We also establish a role for Myc in regulating RNA processing by controlling the incorporation of nonsense mediated decay-determinant exons in RNA binding proteins. Overall design: Whole transcriptome sequencing of three independent cell lines derived from the prostate epithelium of three different human specimens. c-Myc was withdrawn over a time course and mRNA was collected at 0 and 24 hours.

{"prompt": "Title: AR regulated transcriptome in prostate cancer cells. Summary: It has been well established that the transcription factor androgen receptor (AR) is obligatory for prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression, but the precise role of the AR in these processes is still unclear. To dissect the role of AR in shaping the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells, RNA-seq data were obtained from AR-positive LNCaP cells treated with various regimens to manipulate endogenous AR signaling. LNCaP cells were cultured in normal medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) to represent an androgen-dependent (AD) growth state. To mimic the clinical androgen-deprivation-therapy (ADT) settings, cells were grown for 4 days in conditions of either depletion of androgen (i.e., medium containing charcoal:dextran stripped fetal bovine serum (CDSS)) or the presence of AR antagonist Enzalutamide (MDV3100, 10 \u00b5M) to represent androgen-independent (AI) growth states. Aside from the pharmaceutical modulations, we also utilized siRNA to knockdown AR. To examine the direct effects of AR signaling on gene transcription and splicing, cells were primed with CDSS for 3 days followed by treatment of 10nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 8-9 hrs. Deep sequencing of rRNA-depleted total RNAs was performed in biological duplicates on abovementioned LNCaP cultures.

{"prompt": "Title: Impact of splicing factors (ESRP1 and KHDRBS3) on prostate cancer biology. Summary: Dysregulation of mRNA alternative splicing (AS) has been implicated in development and progression of hematological malignancies. How the global AS dysregulation contributes to the development and progression of solid tumors remains generally unclear. Recently, we show that many splicing factors (such as ESRP1 and KHDRBS3) are overexpressed in human primary prostate cancer (PCa) versus normal tissues. To further determine the biological impact of splicing factors on PCa aggressiveness, we treated AR- PC3 cells with siRNAs against either ESRP1 or KHDRBS3 and both. RNA-seq analysis was done in triplicates of rRNA-depleted total RNAs isolated from PC3 cells 48-72hr after siRNA infection. rMATS and DEseq2 were used to reveal the effect of knocking down ESRP1 and/or KHDRBS3 individually or in combination on mRNA splicing landscape and gene expression change.

{"prompt": "Title: Therapeutic targeting of splicing in aggressive prostate cancer. Summary: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main therapeutic regimen for patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa). However, most treated patients invariably develop the castration-resistant disease (i.e., CRPC). Mechanisms underlying CRPC development and maintenance remain poorly understood. Recent studies have established splicing dysregulation as a new molecular hallmark of cancer. However, the functional and clinical relevance of such misregulation have not been systematically explored in PCa. Experimentally, we show that splicing modulator, E7107, can significantly inhibits CRPC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. To determine the mechanistic origins of therapeutic effect of E7107 in vitro, we treated AR+ LNCaP and AR- PC3 cells with DMSO or E7107 at 10nM for 6 h, followed by deep RNA-seq analysis of rRNA-depleted total RNAs isolated from biological triplicates. Furthermore, to evaluate the activity of E7107 against CRPC in vivo, we utilized Enzalutamide-resistant LAPC9-AI (androgen-independent) and PC3 models. RNA-seq experiments we performed on tumors exactly 4 h after the fifth injection of E7107 (5mg/kg/day, 5-days injection considered as 1-dose treatment). Five tumors were included for each group (vehicle or E7107) for deep RNA-seq.

{"prompt": "Title: Overcoming primary and acquired resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy by induction and activation of tumor-residing cDC1s. Summary: T-cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a significant obstacle in cancer immunotherapy. Evidence indicates crucial roles of Batf3-dependent dendritic cells for inducing antitumor T-cell immunity. However, strategies to maximize the engagement of Batf3-dependent dendritic cells  into such 'cold tumors' remain elusive.  Using multiple syngeneic orthotopic mouse models of non-T cell-inflamed tumors, we hypothesized that in situ induction and activation of tumor-residing Batf3-dependent dendritic cells  overcomes poor T-cell infiltration.  In situ immunomodulation with Flt3L, radiotherapy, and TLR3/CD40 stimulation induces an influx of stem-like Tcf1+Slamf6+CD8+ T cells, triggers robust regression not only of primary, but also untreated distant tumors, and renders non-T cell-inflamed tumors responsive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, serial ISIM reshapes repertoires of intratumoral T cells, overcomes acquired resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy, resulting in eradication of tumors, and establishes tumor-specific immunological memory. These findings provide new insights into Batf3-dependent dendritic cells  biology as a critical determinant to the formation of a T cell-inflamed TME. Overall design: To investigate treatment effects on tumor infiltrating immune cell populations, we sorted live tumor-infiltrating CD45+ cells from subcutaneous (s.c.)

{"prompt": "Title: RNA editing enzyme APOBEC3A promotes pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization. Summary: Macrophages acquire a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in response to microbial products or pro-inflammatory cytokines through incompletely understood molecular mechanisms. We recently described the induction of APOBEC3A-mediated cellular site-specific cytosine-to-uracil (C>U) RNA editing during M1 macrophage polarization. However, the functional significance of this RNA editing is unknown. Here, we find that cellular RNA editing by APOBEC3A can also be induced by influenza or Maraba virus infections in normal macrophages, and by interferons in tumor-associated macrophages. Gene knockdown and RNA Seq analyses show that APOBEC3A induces C>U RNA editing (range 7%-88%) of 209 exonic or UTR sites in 203 genes during M1 polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages. The highest level of deleterious protein-recoding C>U RNA editing is observed in THOC5, which encodes a key nuclear protein implicated in the export of mRNAs during M-CSF driven macrophage differentiation. Knockdown of APOBEC3A in M1 macrophages reduces pro-inflammatory IL6, IL23A, and IL12B gene expression, CD80 and CD86 surface protein expression, and TNF-a, IL-1\u00df and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and increases glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. These results demonstrate that APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase plays an important role in transcriptomic and functional polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages.

{"prompt": "Title: MUC1-C integrates activation of the IFN-? pathway with suppression of the tumor immune microenvironment in triple-negative breast cancer. Summary: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have had a profound impact on the treatment of many tumors; however, their effectiveness against triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) has been limited. One factor limiting responsiveness of TNBCs to ICIs is a lack of functional tumor i-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in '\u201cnon-inflamed'\u201d or '\u201ccold'\u201d tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs), albeitalthough by unknown mechanisms. Targeting MUC1-C in a mouse transgenic TNBC tumor model increases cytotoxic tumor -infiltrating CD8 + T cells (CTLs), supporting a role for MUC1-C in immune evasion. The basis for these findings and whether they extend to human TNBCs are not known.

{"prompt": "Title: p300/CBP mediated activation of MHCI machinery and IFNg receptor loci controls chemoimmunotherapy. Summary: Certain chemotherapeutic drugs potentiate responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including PD-(L)1 antibodies, but the mechanisms underlying this synergism are poorly understood.  Many cancers evade immune rejection by suppressing MHC-I antigen processing and presentation (AgPP). We show that two classes of DNA damaging drugs, platinoids (e.g. oxaliplatin) and topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g. mitoxanthrone), induce NF-kB activation, nuclear translocation of the histone and lysine acetyl transferases p300/CBP, interferon (IFN) regulatory factors and IFNg receptor 2 (IFNgR2). This results in transcriptional activation of loci coding for the MHC-I transactivator NLRC5 and components of the MHC-I AgPP machinery. Accordingly, p300 inactivation prevents drug-induced upregulation of MHC-I antigen presentation leading to impaired recognition of cancer cells by effector CD8+ T cells, whose tumor rejecting activity is IFNgR2-dependent. Correspondingly, EP300 loss in human cancers correlates with reduced expression of MHC-I related genes and/or changes in neoantigen amount and expression, suggesting that p300 is an immune-directed oncosuppressor.

{"prompt": "Title: Recurrent frameshift neoantigen vaccine elicits protective immunity with reduced tumor burden and improved overall survival in a Lynch syndrome mouse model. Summary: DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) drives microsatellite instability (MSI). Cells with MSI accumulate numerous frameshift mutations. Frameshift mutations affecting cancer-related genes may promote tumorigenesis and, therefore, are shared among independently arising MSI tumors. Consequently, such recurrent frameshift mutations can give rise to shared immunogenic frameshift peptides (FSPs) that represent ideal candidates for a vaccine against MSI cancer. Pathogenic germline variants of mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome affecting approximately 20-25 million individuals worldwide. LS individuals are at high risk of developing MSI cancer. Previously, we demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of an FSP-based vaccine in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial. However, the cancer-preventive effect of FSP vaccination in the scenario of LS has not been demonstrated so far.
