{"prompt": "Title: MUC1-C INTEGRATES CHRONIC TYPE II INTERFERON SIGNALING WITH CHROMATIN REMODELING PATHWAYS IN IMMUNOSUPPRESSION OF PROSTATE CANCER. Summary: The cancer stem cell (CSC) state is intimately associated with suppression of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). The oncogenic MUC1-C protein drives dedifferentiation of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) CSCs in association with induction of the BAF, NuRD and PBAF chromatin remodeling complexes. The present work demonstrates that MUC1-C is necessary for expression of IFNGR1 and activation of the type II interferon-gamma (IFN-?? pathway in CRPC cells. We show that the MUC1-C?ARID1A/BAF pathway induces IFNGR1 transcription and that MUC1-C?NuRD signaling suppresses FBXW7 in stabilizing the IFNGR1 protein. MUC1-C and NuRD were also necessary for expression of the downstream STAT1 and IRF1 transcription factors. Additionally and in contrast, our results demonstrate that MUC1-C and the PBRM1/PBAF pathway are necessary for IRF1-induced expression of (i) IDO1, WARS and PTGES, which metabolically suppress the immune TME, and (ii) the ISG15 and SERPINB9 inhibitors of T cell function. Of translational relevance, we show that MUC1 associates with expression of IFNGR1, STAT1 and IRF1, as well as the downstream IDO1, WARS, PTGES, ISG15 and SERPINB9 immunosuppressive effectors in CRPC tumors. Consistent with these results, MUC1 associates with immune cell-depleted \u201ccold\u201d CRPC TMEs. These findings demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates chronic activation of the type II IFN-G pathway with induction of chromatin remodeling complexes in linking CSC dedifferentiation and immune evasion.

{"prompt": "Title: IDO1 inhibition and subsequent metabolic adaptations constrains anti-tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment of patients with ovarian cancer. Summary: To uncover underlying mechanisms associated with failure of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) blockade in clinical trials, we conducted a pilot, window-of-opportunity clinical study testing the immunological and metabolic effects of the IDO1 inhibitor, epacadostat, in seventeen patients with newly diagnosed advanced high grade serous ovarian cancer prior to their standard tumor debulking surgery. Comprehensive immunologic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic characterization of the tumor microenvironment using baseline and post-treatment tissue biopsies revealed efficient blockade of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. This blockade was accompanied by a metabolic adaptation that shunted tryptophan catabolism towards the serotonin pathway and elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ biosynthetic pathways, which was detrimental for T cell proliferation and function. Treatment of mice bearing IDO1 over-expressing ovarian tumors with the NAMPT inhibitor, FK866, did not improve tumor control by epacadostat. Because NAD+ metabolites could be ligands for purinergic receptors, we investigated the impact of blocking purinergic receptors in the presence of NAD+. We demonstrated that A2a and A2b, or the combination of A2a and A2b purinergic receptor antagonists rescued NAD+-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation, and the combination of IDO inhibition and A2a/A2b receptor blockade improved survival in the IDO1 over-expressing ovarian tumor bearing hosts. These findings unravel previously unrecognized downstream adaptive metabolic consequences of IDO1 blockade that may undermine efforts to induce tumor-specific T cell responses. Overall design: 8 matched pre-post treatment RNASeq samples IE9MP1_IDO mouse samples:  8 vehicle. Treatment samples: 5 Incyte, 5 FK866, 5 FK866-Incyte, 4 A2a, 2 A2b, 2 Triple..

We report that expression of the oncogenic MUC1-C protein in SCLC cells integrates activation of MYC and the E2F pathway.

Here, we report that the oncogenic MUC1-C protein is necessary for inducing chromatin accessibility and activation of the STAT1 and IRF1 genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.
